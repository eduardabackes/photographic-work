        <h1>My Journey</h1>
        <p>
            Photography has always been a way for me to see the world differently, but my journey truly began when I was 18. 
            My uncle gifted me my first professional camera, and at the time, I saw it as a fun tool to capture moments with friends. 
            I started taking pictures casually, experimenting with angles and lighting, but I had no idea that this simple gift would ignite a deep passion within me.
            <br><br>
            It was during my first big trip that everything changed. I brought my camera along, not expecting much, but as I stood before breathtaking landscapes—vast mountains, endless oceans, golden sunsets—I felt something shift. 
            Capturing the beauty of nature through my lens made me feel connected to the world in a way I had never experienced before. 
            <br><br>
            Since then, my camera has become my constant companion on every trip and adventure. I find inspiration in the raw beauty of nature, in the way it reminds us of how vast and incredible the world is. 
            <br><br>
            Photography allows me to capture not just images, but emotions, memories, and stories. Through my work, I hope to share the awe and wonder I feel when I stand before nature’s masterpieces. 
            I want my photos to inspire others to see the beauty in the world around them, to pause, to appreciate, and to reconnect with the natural world.
            <br><br>
            This is more than just a passion for me—it’s a way of life, a way of seeing, and a way of sharing the magic that surrounds us every day.
